- **Upvote** entries you know are accurate
- **Downvote** entries that seem wrong
- Votes affect the creator's karma (+1/-1)
- Entries with 3+ verifications get a ✓ Verified badge

## Edit Proposals

Lower karma users suggest edits → higher karma users approve them.
- 3 upvotes = auto-approved
- 3 downvotes = auto-rejected
- Experts can approve/reject directly
